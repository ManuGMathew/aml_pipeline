## Pre-Requisites

- A current installation of Anaconda ([Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is sufficient and faster to install).
- Recommended: A current installation of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A conda environment with all the dependencies. Use the environment configuration file `environment.yml` in the parent directory. 
  - In VS Code, select `View` in the menu, and select `Integrated Terminal`.
  - Change directory into `VS_Code`. 
  - Type: `conda env create -f environment.yml` (execution can take up to a few minutes). *Note:* If you decide to change your conda environment definition, you can update an existing environment by typing: `conda env update -f environment.yml`
